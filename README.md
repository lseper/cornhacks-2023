# Climbing The Ladder
an office deer simulator game created for Cornhacks 2023.

## The Introductory Memo
Dear **New Employee**,
Welcome to Climbing the Ladder!

You play as an intrepid business deer who just got a job as a new software developer at an upstart tech firm!

You need to tackle the issue tickets your superiors are throwing at you - but this company has a... unique way of handing out work.

Slimes represent issue tickets. The more slimes you slay, the higher your position in the company. Try your best not to die on company time.

Aim for the top! A secret might be waiting for you up there...

- your benevolent superior

####Innovation & Creativity
- We've always wanted to build a game together, and we thought that a business-oriented title would be an enjoyable endeavor to build. Everything in the game, from the music, to the art, to all the code in-between, was created from scratch. :)

####Problem Solved
- We believed that there aren't enough "office deer simulator" titles in the world, so we sought to change that.

####Completeness
- Our game, albeit simple, does have an end state; the player is eventually felled by a slime.
